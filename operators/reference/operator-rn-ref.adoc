==== Bug fixes

[id="ocp-4-9-9-BZ2022570"]
* Previously, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) ignored the `spec.overrides[].group` when deciding whether to override a manifest. Consequently, overridden entries might match multiple resources, which could override more resources than an admin might have intended. Additionally, overridden entries with an invalid group were considered a match, and `kubeadmin` users might have been using invalid group values without noticing. With this update, the CVO requires group matching when applying configured overrides. As a result, the CVO no longer matches multiple manifests with a single override. Instead, the CVO only matches the manifest with the correct group. `Kubeadmin` users` who had been previously using an invalid group will have to update to the correct group in order to have their overrides continue to match.

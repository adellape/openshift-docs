= Running as a deployment inside the cluster

You can run your Operator project as a deployment inside of your cluster.

.Procedure

. Update the following lines in the project root-level Dockerfile to use supported images.

.. Change the default builder image reference from:
+
[source,terminal]
----
golang:1.15
----
+
to:
+
[source,terminal]
----
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/builder:rhel-8-golang-1.15-openshift-4.7
----

.. Change the default runner image reference from:
+
[source,terminal]
----
gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot
----
+
to:
+
[source,terminal]
----
registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:latest
----

.. Remove the `USER: nonroot:nonroot` directive, as it is not required by the supported image.

. In the `config/default/manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml` file, change the `image` value from:
+
[source,terminal]
----
gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:<tag>
----
+
to use the supported image:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-kube-rbac-proxy:v{product-version}
----

. Run the following `make` commands to build and push the Operator image. Modify the `IMG` argument in the following steps to reference a repository that you have access to. You can obtain an account for storing containers at repository sites such as Quay.io, which this example uses.

.. Set your Quay.io user name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export USERNAME=<quay_username>
----

.. Build the image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make docker-build IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/memcached-operator:v0.0.1
----

.. Push the image to a repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make docker-push IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/memcached-operator:v0.0.1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The name and tag of the image, for example `IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>`, in both the commands can also be set in your Makefile. Modify the `IMG ?= controller:latest` value to set your default image name.
====

. Run the following command to deploy the Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make deploy IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/memcached-operator:v0.0.1
----
+
By default, this command creates a namespace named `<project_name>-system`, for example `memcached-operator-system`, and is used for the deployment. This command also installs the RBAC manifests from `config/rbac`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you enabled webhooks in your deployments, you must have `cert-manager` already installed in the cluster or the `make deploy` command will fail when it attempts to create the `cert-manager` resources.
====

. Verify that the `memcached-operator` is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n memcached-operator-system
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
memcached-operator-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           8m
----

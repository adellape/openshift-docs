= Implementing the controller

After creating a new API and controller, you can implement the controller logic.

.Procedure

* For this example, replace the generated controller file `controllers/memcached_controller.go` with the `memcached_controller.go` link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v1.2.0/testdata/go/memcached-operator/controllers/memcached_controller.go[example implementation].
+
The example controller runs the following reconciliation logic for each `Memcached` custom resource (CR):
+
--
* Create a Memcached deployment if it does not exist.
* Ensure that the deployment size is the same as specified by the `Memcached` CR spec.
* Update the `Memcached` CR status with the names of the `memcached` pods.
--

The next subsections explain how the controller watches resources and how the reconcile loop is triggered. You can skip these subsections to go directly to building and running the Operator.

= Resources managed by quotas

The following describes the set of compute resources and object types that may
be managed by a quota.

[NOTE]
====
A pod is in a terminal state if `status.phase in (Failed, Succeeded)` is true.

|Resource Name |Description

|`*cpu*`
|The sum of CPU requests across all pods in a non-terminal state cannot exceed
this value. `*cpu*` and `*requests.cpu*` are the same value and can be used
interchangeably.

|`*memory*`
|The sum of memory requests across all pods in a non-terminal state cannot
exceed this value. `*memory*` and `*requests.memory*` are the same value and can
be used interchangeably.

|`*ephemeral-storage*`
|The sum of local ephemeral storage requests across all pods in a non-terminal
state cannot exceed this value. `*ephemeral-storage*` and
`*requests.ephemeral-storage*` are the same value and can be used
interchangeably. This resource is available only if you enabled the ephemeral
storage technology preview. This feature is disabled by
default.

|`*requests.cpu*`
|The sum of CPU requests across all pods in a non-terminal state cannot exceed
this value. `*cpu*` and `*requests.cpu*` are the same value and can be used
interchangeably.

|`*requests.memory*`
|The sum of memory requests across all pods in a non-terminal state cannot
exceed this value. `*memory*` and `*requests.memory*` are the same value and can
be used interchangeably.

|`*requests.ephemeral-storage*`
|The sum of ephemeral storage requests across all pods in a non-terminal state
cannot exceed this value. `*ephemeral-storage*` and
`*requests.ephemeral-storage*` are the same value and can be used
interchangeably. This resource is available only if you enabled the ephemeral
storage technology preview. This feature is disabled by default.

|`*limits.cpu*`
|The sum of CPU limits across all pods in a non-terminal state cannot exceed
this value.

|`*limits.memory*`
|The sum of memory limits across all pods in a non-terminal state cannot exceed
this value.

|`*limits.ephemeral-storage*`
|The sum of ephemeral storage limits across all pods in a non-terminal state
cannot exceed this value. This resource is available only if you enabled the
ephemeral storage technology preview. This feature is disabled by default.

|`*requests.storage*`
|The sum of storage requests across all persistent volume claims in any state cannot
exceed this value.

|`*persistentvolumeclaims*`
|The total number of persistent volume claims that can exist in the project.

|`*<storage-class-name>.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/requests.storage*`
|The sum of storage requests across all persistent volume claims in any state that have a matching storage class, cannot exceed this value.

|`*<storage-class-name>.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/persistentvolumeclaims*`

You can configure an object count quota for these standard namespaced resource types using the `count/<resource>.<group>` syntax
while xref:create-a-quota[creating a quota].

----
$ oc create quota <name> --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota> <1>
----

<1> `<resource>` is the name of the resource, and `<group>` is the API group, if applicable.
Use the `kubectl api-resources` command for a list of resources and their associated API groups.

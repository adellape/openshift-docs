= About channels

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) provides a channel concept that allows you as the operator author a means to specify a set of update streams for your operator.

Operator authors deal with two key tasks associated with OLM channels, first, how to define a channel for your operator and then lastly how to interact with OLM to deploy your operator using channels.

For each version of an operator you can specify a channel that it will belong to. Since there can be multiple versions of an operator within a channel, there is a notion of the latest version within a channel, or the channel head version. It's the channel head that OLM will install for most subscriptions.

There can also be multiple channels for a given operator package which is used to offer different support models (e.g. pre-release, production). Here is a diagram that shows the relationship of operator versions to channels:

In the diagram above you can see the following:

* A catalog named “vendor:v4.6”, this catalog is built by a cluster administrator typically
* There are 2 operator packages found in the catalog, myoperator and otheroperator.
* The myoperator has 3 bundles (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2). Versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 are in multiple channels (fast, stable). Whereas version 1.0.2 is only in the fast channel.
* The otheroperator has 2 bundles specifying 2 different channels (candidate, stable). Version 1.4.0 specifies it is within 2 channels, stable and candidate.

Here is the view of another catalog, “vendor:v4.7”, that shows you can change the upgrade path for an operator by what operator bundles are contained within the catalog:

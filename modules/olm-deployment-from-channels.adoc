= Operator deployment from channels

When an end user or administrator wants to deploy an operator using OLM, they create a Subscription manifest, e.g:

.Example subscription
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: sample-subscription
  namespace: my-operators
spec:
  channel: candidate
  name: sampleoperator
  source: sample-operator
  sourceNamespace: my-operators
----

The Subscription is providing hints to OLM which are used to determine exactly which version of an operator will get deployed onto the cluster, in this example OLM will look for an operator to deploy that belongs to the candidate channel within a specified catalog source.

Note that exactly which operator version is deployed can depend on more than what you specify in the Subscription. On initial install, OLM will always attempt to install whatever is the head of the specified channel by default. Settings within the operatorâ€™s CSV also are used by OLM to determine exactly which operator version OLM will deploy or upgrade.

= About the OpenShift CLI

With the {product-title} command-line interface (CLI), you can create applications and manage {product-title} projects from a terminal. The OpenShift CLI is ideal in the following situations:

* Working directly with project source code
* Scripting {product-title} operations
* Working while restricted by bandwidth resources and the web console is unavailable

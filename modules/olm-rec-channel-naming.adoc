|Channel name |Purpose |Supported

|`candidate`
|Pre-release operators that would typically not have support offered and might be considered experimental. Release candidates contain all the features of the product but are not supported. Use release candidate versions to test feature acceptance and assist in qualifying the next version of Operator. A release candidate is any build that is available in the candidate channel, including ones that do not contain a pre-release version such as `-rc` in their names. After a version is available in the candidate channel, it goes through more quality checks. If it meets the quality standard, it is promoted to the `fast` or `stable` channels. Because of this strategy, if a specific release is available in both the `candidate` channel and in the `fast` or `stable` channels, it is a supported version. The `candidate` channel can include release versions from which there are no recommended updates in any channel.
|No

|`fast`
|Released, supported operators which are still being monitored to assess stability/quality prior to promoting them as stable. Generally used by early adopters or for testing in pre-production environments. The `fast` channel ought to be updated with new and previous minor versions of the Operator as soon as it declares the given version as a general availability release. As such, these releases are fully supported, are production quality, and have performed well while available as a release candidate in the `candidate` channel from where they were promoted. Some time after a release appears in the `fast` channel, it is added to the `stable` channel. If you adopted the `fast` and/or `candidate` channel then, releases never should appear in the stable channel before they appears in the `fast` and/or `candidate`. Ensure that you have a good understanding of channel promotion.
|Yes

|`stable`
|Released, supported operators that have been observed to be stable through usage by consumers of the fast channel. While the fast channel contains releases as soon as their are published with a support statement, releases are added to the stable channel after a delay in this case. During this delay, data could to be collected, for example, to ensure the stability of the release.
|Yes
|===

With this channel naming convention, you are always moving end users to the latest versions of your operator. For example, you could create a version `1.1.1` that is considered fast, adding it to the `fast` channel. Users can experiment with that fast version, but the stable version for example `1.2.0` would be added only to the `stable` channel.

[NOTE]
====
The above terminology and support statements are very similar to the link:https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels[channels of distribution used by Kubernetes] and {product-title}. In this way, by adopting it you will bring a better and more intuitive understanding for the maintainers, users and community.

== Following Operator major versions

|Channels for Operator version(s) v2.x

|`candidate-v2`
|`fast-v2`
|`stable-v2`
|===

By following this channel naming convention, you would provide the major versions of the Operators in the channel naming. So that your consumers can be subscribed to a channel where they can safely install the latest versions published on it and avoid workflow issues on their cluster because they know that none of the solutions which will be distributed within contains breaking changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The versions on the channel names are related to the Operator version and not its Operand.

|Channels for Operator v1.3 |Channels for Operator v2.4

|`candidate-v1.3`
|`candidate-v2.4`

|`fast-v1.3`
|`fast-v2.4`

|`stable-v1.3`
|`stable-v2.4`
|===

An operator wants to be supported at various operator major/minor versions.
For example, you might have an operator version at `1.3` and also at `2.4` that you need or want to offer support for at the same time. However, you might not want to have OLM upgrade users to the `2.4` Operator but instead keep them upgrading within the `1.3` versions. In that case, you would end up with channels as recommended above but with major/minor version information applied.

|Postgres v12 |Channels for Postgres v13

|`candidate-pg-v12`
|`candidate-pg-v13`

|`fast-pg-v12`
|`fast-pg-v13`

|`stable-pg-v12`
|`stable-pg-v13`
|===

Another form of channel naming might have the operand version be specified instead of the operator version. For example, consider a database operator that has operands of different database versions such as Version 12 or Version 13. In this case, you might have the need to advertise your channels by the operand version as shown above.

In this example, subscribers know which database version they are subscribing to and donâ€™t necessarily care which operator version is being used, but will likely just want the latest operator version in that channel. As with the previous naming convention examples, we start the channel name with candidate/fast/stable to denote the maturity level of the operator. Using all 3 naming prefixes is optional, you might only want to support a stable channel.

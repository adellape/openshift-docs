= Channel definitions

Operator authors define the channels they intend to use by creating labels within their operator bundle. Bundles contain metadata about a particular operator version. For example, when you build an operator bundle, you specify an annotations.yaml manifest which gets included into the bundle image. Here is an example snippet of an annotations.yaml file including channel information for that operator:

.Example annotations
[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.channels.v1: candidate
  operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.channel.default.v1: candidate
  operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.manifests.v1: manifests/
  operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.mediatype.v1: registry+v1
  operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.metadata.v1: metadata/
  operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.package.v1: otheroperator
----

This example shows that you are defining the candidate channel to be used for this operator bundle. Operator bundles are loaded into an Operator Index image using the opm command. It is important to note that by specifying a channel value like this, you are essentially creating a channel which can then be subscribed to. If you mis-type the channel name, there is nothing that validates the channel value because the channel is known by whatever you provide.

Note that you can specify a default channel for a given operator package. This default channel is used when an operator is being installed to fulfill a dependency requirement of another operator. The dependent operator will be installed from the dependent operator’s default channel as the first choice, falling back to other channels the dependent operator provides as necessary. Default channels for an operator package are determined by the order in which operator bundles are added to the catalog, with the last bundle’s default channel value being used. Note the default channel is also used if you create a Subscription that doesn’t specify a channel.

If your operator bundles do not specify a default channel, a default channel will be picked by OLM based on the lexical ordering of the channels you have specified. For example, if your bundles specified channels of candidate and stable, then candidate would be picked based solely on the names chosen and character ordering (e.g. `p` comes before `s`). Dependency resolution is described in more detail link:https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/concepts/olm-architecture/dependency-resolution/[here].

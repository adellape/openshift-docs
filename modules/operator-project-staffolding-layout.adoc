After creating a new Operator project using the `operator-sdk new` command, the
project directory has numerous generated folders and files. The following table
provides a basic overview of each generated file and directory.

|File/Folders |Purpose

a|*_Gopkg.toml_* +
*_Gopkg.lock_*

|The link:https://github.com/golang/dep[Go Dep] manifests that describe the
external dependencies of this Operator.

|*_cmd/_*
|Contains the *_main.go_* file, which is the entry point to initialize and start
this Operator using the Operator SDK APIs.

|*_config/_*
|Contains metadata about state of this project such as `projectName`, `kind`,
`apiVersion`, and so forth. The `operator-sdk` commands use this metadata to
perform actions that require knowing the state.

|*_deploy/_*
|Contains a generic set of Kubernetes manifests for deploying this Operator on a
Kubernetes cluster.

|*_pkg/apis/_*
|Contains the directory tree that defines the APIs and types of Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs). These files allow the SDK to do code generation for CRD
types and register the schemes for all types in order to correctly decode Custom
Resource (CR) objects.

|*_pkg/stub/_*
|Contains the *_handler.go_* file, which is the place for a user to write all the
operating business logic.

|*_tmp/_*
|Contains scripts that the Operator SDK uses for build and code generation.

|*_vendor/_*
|The golang link:https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories[vendor] folder
that contains the local copies of the external dependencies that satisfy the
imports of this project. link:https://github.com/golang/dep[Go Dep] manages the
vendor directly.

|*_version/_*
|Contains the version for the Operator project.

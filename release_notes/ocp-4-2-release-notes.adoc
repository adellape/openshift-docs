[id="ocp-4-2-about-this-release"]
== About this release

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:2921[RHBA-2019:2921]) is now
available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.14 with CRI-O runtime. New features,
changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are
included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.openshift.com/openshift. The Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 and
later, as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 4.1.

You must use {op-system-first} for the control plane, or master, machines and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for compute, or worker,
machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.6 is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.

[id="ocp-4-2-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-2-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-2-migrations"]
==== Migrations

Tooling and advice for moving from {product-title} 3.x to 4.x is now available.

[id="ocp-4-2-openshift-install"]
==== CLI-based installation

{product-title} {product-version} introduces a new CLI-based installer called
`openshift-install`. It is designed to simplify provisioning OpenShift on
immutable installer provisioned infrastructure using an interactive guided
workflow within about 30 minutes. This approach provides an OpenShift deployment
with full stack automation of host OS and platform updates and infrastructure
management without the complexity of having to provision your own
infrastructure. Only minimal user input is needed with all non-essential
installation configuration options, which are now configured post-installation
via component operator Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

Updates are performed largely the same way. OpenShift update content must be
mirrored first to the local container registry first then the administrator
tells `oc adm upgrade` where to pull the update content from.

[id="ocp-4-2-installations-in-restricted-networks"]
==== Installations in restricted networks

{product-title} {product-version} introduces support for installation and
updating {product-title} clusters in restricted network environments. It is
designed to work with any `docker` 2.2 spec-compliant container registry for
hosting {product-title} content.

Administrators first must replicate content from Quay.io to their local
container registry. After that is done, `openshift-install` can be configured to
generate Ignition configs that pull content locally rather than from Quay.io.
This is designed to work with user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) deployments
only.

You can still use Operators from the OLM catalog in restricted networks.
However, you must manually pull the Operator sources in order to populate the
the offline catalog. This manual process is only a temporary workaround for
{product-title} {product-version}. An automated solution will be provided in a
future release.

See
xref:../installing/installing_restricted_networks/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-preparations[Installing in restricted networks]
and xref:../applications/operators/olm-disconnected.adoc#olm-disconnected[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks]
for details.

[id="ocp-4-2-cluster-wide-egresss-proxy"]
==== Cluster-wide egress proxy

{product-title} {product-version} introduces support for installing and updating
an OpenShift cluster through a corporate proxy server. Proxy information
(httpProxy, httpsProxy, and noProxy) can be defined in `install-config`, which
is used during the installation process and can also be managed
post-installation via the cluster proxy object.

Also, there is now support for providing your own CA bundles allowing the
corporate proxy to MITM HTTPS.

[id="ocp-4-2-new-platform-boundary"]
==== New platform boundary

{product-title} is now aware of the entire infrastructure and brings the
operating system under management. This makes installation and updates seamless
across the platform and the underlying operating system. Everything is managed
as a single entity.

[id="ocp-4-2-IPI-UPI"]
==== IPI and UPI

In {product-title} {product-version}, there are two primary installation
experiences: Full stack automation (IPI) and pre-existing infrastructure (UPI).

With full stack automation, the installer controls all areas of the installation
including infrastructure provisioning with an opinionated best practices
deployment of {product-title}. With re-existing infrastructure deployments,
administrators are responsible for creating and managing their own
infrastructure allowing greater customization and operational flexibility.

[id="ocp-4-2-full-stack-automated-deployments"]
==== Full stack automated deployments

In {product-title} {product-version}, there is expanded support for full stack
automated deployments to include AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP),
and Red Hat OpenStack Platform, as well as adding GCP to the existing list of
user provisioned infrastructure supported providers that already includes AWS,
Bare Metal, and VMware vSphere.

[id="ocp-4-2-operators"]
=== Operators

[id="ocp-4-2-scoped-operator-installations"]
==== Scoped Operator installations

Previously, only users carrying `cluster-admin` roles  were allowed to install
Operators. In {product-title} 4.2, the `cluster-admin` can select namespaces in
which namespace administrators can install Operators self-sufficiently. The
`cluster-admin` defines the ServiceAccount in this namespace; all installed
Operators in this namespace get equal or lower permissions of this
ServiceAccount.

See
xref:../applications/operators/olm-creating-policy.adoc#olm-creating-policy[Creating policy for Operator installations and upgrades]
for details.

[id="ocp-4-2-ingress-operator"]
==== Ingress Operator
The Ingress Operator supports all ingress features on {product-version} with
installer-provisioned infrastructure on Azure and GCP.

[id="ocp-4-2-machine-config-operator"]
==== Machine Config Operator

The Machine Config Operator (MCO) provides cluster-level configuration, enables
rolling upgrades, and prevents drift between new and existing nodes.

[id="ocp-4-2-node-feature-discovery-operator"]
==== Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator detects hardware features available
on each node and advertises those features using node labels.

CPU features managed by NFD include:

* cpuid
* hardware_multithreading
* power
* pstate

Kernel features managed by NFD include:

* config
* selinux_enabled
* version
* os_version

Other features managed by NFD include:

* NVMe
* NUMA
* SR-IOV
* GPUs

The NFD Operator manages the installation and lifecycle of the NFD DaemonSet.
Access the NFD Operator in OperatorHub.

[id="ocp-4-2-node-tuning-operator-enhancements"]
==== Node Tuning Operator enhancements

The Node Turning Operator was first introduced in {product-title} 4.1 and
manages cluster node-level tuning; The default CR is meant for delivering
standard node-level tuning. The enhancements in {product-title}
{product-version} allow for customizing the tunings for things such as high
performance.

For custom tuning, create your own tuned custom resources (CRs). Newly created
CRs will be combined with the default CR and custom tuning applied to nodes
based on node or pod labels and profile priorities.

[id="ocp-4-2-storage"]
=== Storage

[id="ocp-4-2-persistent-volumes-LSO"]
==== Persistent volumes using the Local Storage Operator

Persistent volumes using the Local Storage Operator is now available in
{product-title} {product-version}.

[id="ocp-4-2-OCS"]
==== OpenShift Container Storage 4.2

With {product-title} {product-version}, OpenShift Container Storage (OCS) 4.2 is
available, providing persistent storage for applications and {product-title}
infrastructure services. OCS 4.2 will provide complete data services for
{product-title}, including dynamic provisioning of object buckets. This S3
capability is new in OCS 4.2. A consistent S3 interface is now added across
public and on-premise infrastructure.

[id="ocp-4-2-CSI"]
==== OpenShift Container Storage Interface (CSI)

Container Storage Interface (CSI) is now available in {product-title}
{product-version}. CSI is introduced in Kubernetes to enable Red Hat OpenShift
Container Storage (OCS) and partners with their CSI plug-ins. With the adoption
of the CSI, the Kubernetes volume layer becomes truly
link:https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/10/container-storage-interface-beta/[extensible].

For now, only the API is available. CSI drivers contained in operators will be
available in future releases.

[id="ocp-4-2-storage-devices"]
==== Storage devices

The Cluster Storage Operator sets up the default storage class. It looks through
the cloud provider and sets up the correct storage class.

Raw Block with iSCSI is now in xref:ocp-4-2-technology-preview[Technology Preview].

New storage devices are supported in {product-title} {product-version}:

* Raw block with local Volumes
* Raw block with cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, and vSphere)

[id="ocp-4-2-scale"]
=== Scale

[id="ocp-4-2-scale-cluster-limits"]
==== Cluster limits

Updated guidance around
xref:../scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-limits.adoc#planning-your-environment-according-to-object-limits[Cluster
Limits] for {product-title} {product-version} is now available.

Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocplimitscalculator/[{product-title}
Limit Calculator] to estimate cluster limits for your environment.

[id="ocp-4-2-developer-experience"]
=== Developer experience

[id="ocp-4-2-ODO"]
==== OpenShift Do

OpenShift Do (ODO) is a CLI tool for developers to create, build, and deploy
applications on OpenShift. ODO is completely client based and requires no server
within the {product-title} cluster for deployment. It detects changes to local
code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to
validate changes in real time. It supports multiple languages and frameworks.

[id="ocp-4-2-nodes"]
=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-2-crio-support"]
==== CRI-O support

CRI-O is a kubernetes-specific container engine that tracks and versions
identical to Kubernetes, simplifying support permutations. Adoption is trivial
because all existing Docker and OCI containers are supported and run well with
CRI-O.  CRI-O is a light weight, kubernetes-native, OCI-compatible container
runtime that is life-cycled and managed by {product-title}. You do not need to
worry about which container runtime is in use. With {product-title}, it is
always the right one and it provide a complete implementation of the Kubernetes
Container Runtime Interface (CRI). Also, you do not need to separately manage
the container engine. CRI-O has some tuneables that provide control and security
for CRI-O; they are easily configured in a CRD, and the settings are propagated
across the cluster.

[id="ocp-4-2-whitelisting-of-sysctls"]
==== Whitelisting of sysctls configuration

System administrators can whitelist sysctl on a per-node basis. All safe sysctls
are enabled by default; all unsafe sysctls are disabled by default.See
xref:../nodes/containers/nodes-containers-sysctls.adoc#nodes-containers-sysctls[Using
sysctls in containers] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-2-master-nodes-schedulable"]
==== Master nodes are now schedulable

In {product-title} {product-version}, master nodes are schedulable. See
xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.adoc[Working with nodes] for more
information.

[id="ocp-4-2-networking"]
=== Networking

==== Installer-provisioned OpenShift on OpenStack

{product-title} {product-version} introduces full-stack automation support for
deploying {product-title} clusters on Red Hat OpenStack.

The installer uses the OpenStack APIs in conjunction with the Kubernetes
OpenStack Cloud Provider to create all the required OpenStack resources, such as
virtual machines (VMs), networks, security groups, and object storage needed to
deploy {product-title} and properly configure the cluster to run on the Red Hat
OpenStack Platform.

{product-title} {product-version} can be deployed on Red Hat OpenStack version
13.

Kuryr exists to improve the network performance of pods when running workloads
on Red Hat OpenStack. Kuryr is an SDN solution combining a Kubernetes CNI plug-in
(kuryr-kubernetes) and OpenStack Neutron to provide interconnectivity between
Kubernetes pods and OpenStack virtual instances.

[id="ocp-4-2-OVN"]
==== OVN (Technology Preview)

Open Virtual Networking (OVN) for Open vSwitch, currently in
xref:ocp-4-2-technology-preview[Technology Preview], has many advantages,
including acceleration of customer-driven feature requirements, some of which
are pre-enabled, including:

* Low barrier to integration; an implementation of virtual networking via OVS.
* SDN portfolio consolidation.
* Virtually eliminate iptables scale issues.
* Heterogeneous Linux/Windows clusters.
* The ability to have a cluster network that spans on-premise nodes and cloud
nodes.
* Full Network Policy support.
* Egress IP per pod.
* Distributed L4 Ingress/Egress firewall.
* Distributed services load balancer.
* Heterogeneous clusters with Windows nodes
* The capability to span on-premise and cloud nodes.
* Traffic isolation and multi-tenancy.
* Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) support.
* Encrypted tunnels.
* IPv6 and DHCPv6.
* QoS, control and data plane separation.

[id="ocp-4-2-enable-ingress-controllers"]
==== Enable internal ingress controllers for private clusters

When creating an IngressController on cloud platforms, the IngressController is
published by a public cloud load balancer by default.

Users can now publish IngressControllers with internal cloud load balancers. For
example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  name: internal
spec:
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: Internal
----

See the
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/#internal-load-balancer.[Kubernetes
Services documentation] for implementation details.

Once set, `.spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.loadBalancer.scope` cannot
be changed. To change the scope, delete and recreate the IngressController.

The `default` IngressController can be made internal by deleting and recreating
it.

[id="ocp-4-2-kubernetes-cni-plug-in-additions"]
==== Kubernetes CNI plug-in additions and enhancements

Several Kubernetes CNI plug-ins are added or enhanced in {product-title}
{product-version} to grow capability.

These SR-IOV solutions remain in Technology Preview in {product-title}
{product-version}:

* RDMA and RoCE Support
* DPDK Mode for SR-IOV VFs
* Admission Controller
* Operator

New CNI plug-ins:

* IPVLAN
* Bridge with VLAN
* Static IPAM

[id="ocp-4-2-enablement-of-GPUs"]
==== Enablement of GPUs in an OpenShift cluster

GPUs are now supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 nodes. They are not
supported on RHEL CoreOS nodes because of lack of support for CUDA driver and
driver containers.

[id="ocp-4-2-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-2-custom-branding"]
==== Console customization options

You can customize the {product-title} web console to set a custom logo, links,
notification banners, and command line downloads. This is especially helpful if you
need to tailor the web console to meet specific corporate or government
requirements.

See Customizing the web console for more information.

[id="ocp-4-2-new-api-explorer"]
==== New API Explorer

You can now easily search and manage API resources in the *Explore API
Resources* dashboard located at *Home* -> *Explore*.

View the schema for each API and what parameters being supported, manage the
instances of the API, and review the access of each API.

[id="ocp-4-2-machine-autoscaler"]
==== Machine Autoscaler

You can now scale your cluster with the Machine Autoscaler. The Machine
Autoscaler adjusts the number of Machines in the MachineSets being deployed in
your cluster. Increase Machines when the cluster runs out of resources to
support more deployments.  Any changes, such as the minimum or maximum number of
instances, are immediately applied to the MachineSet that MachineAutoscalers
target.

[id="ocp-4-2-developer-perspective"]
==== Developer Perspective

The Developer perspective adds a developer-focused perspective to the web
console. It provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as creation
and deployment of applications to {product-title} using multiple options. It
provides a visual representation of the applications within a project, their
build status, and the components and services associated with them,  enabling
easy interaction and monitoring. It incorporates Serverless capabilities
(Technology Preview) and the ability to create workspaces to edit your
application code using Eclipse Che.

[id="ocp-4-2-prometheus-queries"]
==== Prometheus queries

You can now run Prometheus queries directly in the web console. Navigate to
*Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.

[id="ocp-4-2-web-console-idps"]
==== Identity providers

On the cluster OAuth configuration page, more identity providers (IDPs) are
provided for the user to log in to the cluster. The IDPs include GitHub, GitLab,
Google, LDAP, Keystone, and so on.

[id="ocp-4-2-general-web-console-updates"]
==== General web console updates

* The dashboard is redesigned with more metrics.
* *Catalog* is moved to the *Developer* perspective: *Developer* -> *Add+* -> *From
Catalog*.
* Status of projects is now moved to the *Workloads* tab on the project details page.
* OperatorHub is now located under the *Operators* menu.
* There is now support for chargeback. You can break down the reserved and used
resources requested by applications.
* There is now support for native templates without needing to enable the Service
Catalog, which is now deprecated.

[id="ocp-4-2-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the following notable technical
changes.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-corsAllowedOrigins"]
==== corsAllowedOrigins

`corsAllowedOrigins` can now be configured. See
xref:../authentication/allowing-javascript-access-api-server.adoc[Allowing
JavaScript-based access to the API server from additional hosts] for more
information.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-new-cni-plugins"]
==== New CNI plug-ins

There are two new CNI plug-ins for Multus: bridge and ipvlan.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-cno-supports-SimpleMacvlan"]
==== CNO supports SimpleMacvlan

CNO now supports configuring SimpleMacvlan.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-layers"]
==== Builds maintain their layers

In {product-title} {product-version}, builds keep their layers by default.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-windows-builds-not-supported"]
==== Builds on Windows

Builds are not scheduled on Windows nodes.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-ingress-controller-support-disabled"]
==== Ingress controller support disabled

Ingress controller TLS 1.0 and 1.1 support is now disabled to match the
Mozilla intermediate security profile.

New and upgraded ingress controllers will no longer support these TLS versions.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-remove-csc-usage"]
==== Reduce OperatorHub complexity by removing CatalogSourceConfig usage

OperatorHub has been updated to reduce the
number of API resources a cluster administrator must interact with and
streamline the installation of new Operators on {product-title} 4.2.

To work with OperatorHub in {product-title} 4.1, cluster administrators
primarily interacted with OperatorSource and CatalogSourceConfig API resources.
OperatorSources are used to add external datastores where Operator bundles are
stored.

CatalogSourceConfigs were used to enable an Operator present in the
OperatorSource of your cluster. Behind the scenes, it configured an Operator
Lifecycle Manager (OLM) CatalogSource so that the Operator could then be managed
by OLM.

To reduce complexity, OperatorHub in {product-title} 4.2 no longer uses
CatalogSourceConfigs in the workflow of installing Operators. Instead,
CatalogSources are still created as a result of adding OperatorSources to the
cluster, however Subscription resources are now created directly using the
CatalogSource.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-global-catalog-namespace"]
==== Global catalog namespace change

In {product-title} 4.1, the default global catalog namespace, where
CatalogSources are installed by default, is
`openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager`. Starting with {product-title} 4.2, this
has changed to the `openshift-marketplace` namespace.

If you have installed an Operator from OperatorHub on a {product-title} 4.1
cluster, the CatalogSource is in the same namespace as the Subscription. These
Subscriptions are not affected by this change and should continue to behave
normally after a cluster upgrade.

In {product-title} 4.2, if you install an Operator from OperatorHub, the
Subscription created refers to a CatalogSource located in the new global
catalog namespace `openshift-marketplace`.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-global-catalog-namespace-workaround"]
===== Workaround for existing Subscriptions in the previous global catalog namespace

If you have existing CatalogSources in the old
`openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager` namespace, any existing Subscription
objects that are referring to the CatalogSource will fail to upgrade, and new
Subscription objects that are referring to the CatalogSource will fail to
install.

To workaround such upgrade failures:

.Procedure
. Move the CatalogSource object from the previous global catalog namespace to
the `openshift-marketplace` namespace.

[id="ocp-41-deprecated-features"]
=== Deprecated features

(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1690754[*BZ#1690754*])

* `git clone` operations that go through an HTTPS proxy will fail. Non-TLS (HTTP)
proxies can be used successfully.

* Builds that use image references that correlate to an image mirror, which is
the case in a disconnected environment, will fail to pull or push those image
references if the mirror requires authentication.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1745192[*BZ#1745192*])

* Image stream import does not use mirrors. This is often used in disconnected environments.

* `git clone` via SSH does not work through a proxy.

* If builds use a build secret, it is strongly recommended that layers are squashed
using `imageOptimizationPolicy: SkipLayers`. Otherwise, secrets might leak in
`source` and `docker` strategy builds.

The `python` source-to-image (S2I) builders support the following environment variables:

[cols="1,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name |Configuration |Purpose

|APP_FILE
|Deployment
|This environment variable specifies the name of a Python script file, which if it exists, will be executed to run the Python web application. By default the name of the script file is `app.py`.

|APP_MODULE
|Deployment
|This environment variable can be set to specify the name of a Python module containing the WSGI application entry point. By default the name of the Python module is determined by searching for a `wsgi.py` file and translating its location into a Python module name.

|APP_CONFIG
|Deployment
|This environment variable can be set to specify the location of a configuration file for Gunicorn, when the bundled support for using Gunicorn to host a WSGI application is being used. The configuration file must be valid Python code and is interpreted directly by Gunicorn. Consult the Gunicorn link:http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html[documentation] for further details on the settings that are available.

|DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
|Build
|This environment variable controls whether the command `python manage.py collectstatic` is run during the building of the application image. This command would normally be run when a `manage.py` script exists and it was believed a Django application was being deployed. This would be required to be set (to a non empty value) if deploying a Flask application and the Flask-Script add-on was used to provide a `manage.py` for the Flask application.

|DISABLE_MIGRATE
|Deployment
|This environment variable controls whether the command `python manage.py migrate` is run prior to the web application being started. This command would normally be run when a `manage.py` script exists and it was believed a Django application was being deployed. This would be required to be set (to a non empty value) if deploying a Flask application and the Flask-Script add-on was used to provide a `manage.py` for the Flask application.

Note that automatic execution of database migration when deploying a Django application is provided as a convenience when initially getting a Django application running. It is recommended that database migration as part of the start up process of the Django application be disabled for production deployments. Execution of database migration should instead be triggered using life cycle hooks defined as part of the deployment configuration.

|===

These environment variables can be set as part of your source code repository by adding them into the `.s2i/environment` file.

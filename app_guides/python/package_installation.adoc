OpenShift will automatically install for you any Python packages required by your application. You have two choices for how to declare the packages your application requires.

* `requirements.txt` - this file is used with link:https://pip.pypa.io[pip] to install any packages required for your application.

* `setup.py` - this file makes use of link:https://docs.python.org/3.4/distributing/index.html[distutils or setuptools] to install any packages required for your application.

In both cases, the file should be located in the top level directory of your source code repository.

You can use both the `requirements.txt` and `setup.py` file at the same time, in which case `requirements.txt` will be processed first to install packages. It is recommended that accepted best practices as outlined in link:https://caremad.io/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/[setup.py vs requirements.txt] be adhered to, with package dependencies listed in the `setup.py` file being abstract and those in the `requirements.txt` file be concrete. In other words, the `requirements.txt` file should list exact versions of packages you require.

There is no need for your application code to activate any Python virtual environment. The OpenShift source-to-image builder scripts will setup any Python environment for you so that the correct Python version and installed packages are found at run-time.

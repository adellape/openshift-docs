=== Overview

This tutorial walks through the creation of an application titled `myapp`.
Before going through the rest of the tutorial, be sure to
have created an https://console.preview.openshift.com[OpenShift account] and
installed the **oc command line tools**.

=== Step 1: The sample application and git repository

==== Sample Ruby application

The https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/os-sample-ruby[sample application] used
in this tutorial is based on Sinatra and prints out environment variables.

Even though it's a minimal application it will serve well to describe the basic
concepts. You do not have to use our sample application, but for the first steps
it might be helpful.

==== Git repository hosting

To create new application you need to have your source code hosted somewhere
on the internet and have it accessible using git. Popular choices are
https://github.com/[GitHub], https://gitlab.com/[GitLab] or
https://bitbucket.org/[BitBucket]. For example, our sample application is
hosted at Github. For this tutorial you may use the code from the provided
repository or you can https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork] the
repository. Forking is necessary if you want to follow also through `Step 3`.

=== Step 2: Creating new application

==== Creating new application using terminal

Once ready, open a terminal and at the command prompt, enter the following
command to create a Ruby application (replace the username in the URL if you have
forked, or the whole URL if you are using your own application):

[source]
----
oc new-app --name=myapp ruby~https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/os-sample-ruby.git
----

and the output should look something like this

[source]
----
--> Found image d5ca607 (5 weeks old) in image stream "ruby" in project "openshift" under tag "2.2" for "ruby"

    Ruby 2.2
    --------
    Platform for building and running Ruby 2.2 applications

    Tags: builder, ruby, ruby22

    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/os-sample-ruby.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "myapp:latest"
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "myapp"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "myapp"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "myapp"

--> Creating resources with label app=myapp ...
    imagestream "myapp" created
    buildconfig "myapp" created
    deploymentconfig "myapp" created
    service "myapp" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/myapp' to track its progress.
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

The `--name=myapp` names the application. By default it would be the base name
of the URL without extension, in our case `os-sample-ruby`, but it's much
nicer to have the application named `myapp` and that's what we did using this
switch.

OpenShift automatically linked ruby with `Ruby 2.2` as the latest version. You
could as well use `ruby20` as the template to deploy using the specific version,
e.g.

[source]
----
oc new-app --name=myapp ruby20~https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/os-sample-ruby.git
----

OpenShift prints a lot of information that is not that important for
us at this moment, what we care about is if our application is accessible from
the internet and if we can see it running. For exposing application to the
outside world, OpenShift has a concept of `routes` that map domain names to
specific applications. To expose our application we need to know the name of
the internal service in all the information printed when we created our
application it's this line `service "myapp" created`. OpenShift automatically
created new service, according to the name of the application. Now, let's
expose that service, to do that, run this command

[source]
----
oc expose svc myapp
----

and you should see something like this

[source]
----
route "myapp" exposed
----

Now we can run `oc status` to get information about your deployment

[source]
----
oc status
----

and you should see something like this

[source]
----
http://myapp-demo.44fs.preview.openshiftapps.com to pod port 8080-tcp (svc/myapp)
  dc/myapp deploys istag/myapp:latest <-
    bc/myapp builds https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/os-sample-ruby.git with openshift/ruby:2.2
    deployment #1 deployed 41 seconds ago - 1 pod
----

There again is a lot of information that we mostly do not care about at this
moment but what we need is the first line. It shows you the domain, your
application is available at. To access the application, simply open the domain
in your browser of choice and you should see the environment variables.

==== Creating new application using web console

You can deploy your application using web console as well as wit cli tools. To
deploy using web, click on the `Add to project` in the top bar. Then type `ruby`
into the _Filter by keyword_ text field. And you will see list of Ruby based
templates similar to

image::builders-list.png[]

select `ruby:latest` and fill in the form like this

image::new-app.png[]

depending on your selection of forking or not deploying the sample application
you will need to adjust the URL accordingly. And finally click `Create` and you
will be taken to summary page like this

image::new-app-overview.png[]

and click `Continue to overview`. On the overview page you will see detail of
your new deployment similar to

image::new-deployment.png[]

Clicking the URL in the top white box will take you straight to your newly
deployed application with the environment variables.

=== Step 3: Making first changes

To make changes to the application, you need to
https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork] it and deploy from your own
fork instead of from the original repository of the sample application. That
means, that for creating the application the URL will have a different
username/organization.

[source]
----
oc new-app --name=myapp ruby~https://github.com/[your user name]/os-sample-ruby.git
----

Except for that, the whole process process in the Step 1 is the same.

==== Editing the source code
You can edit the source code in Github's web based editor. If you choose to do
so, there no need to copy the source code to your local machine and can skip
directly to Step 2.2.

Or you can clone the repository locally, edit the file, and push back to the
server. To do so, first clone the git repository and enter the new directory

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/[your user name]/os-sample-ruby.git
cd os-sample-ruby
----

Edit the `config.ru` file to your liking and commit the changes

[source]
----
git add -A .
git commit -m "My application changes"
----

and finally push back to the git hosting

[source]
----
git push origin master
----

and that's it, the change is in the git repository, now let's go and deploy it.

==== Deploying the changes using terminal

OpenShift already knows how to reach your git repository as it did while first
deploying the application. As it created the service that we referenced before
it also created buildconfig `buildconfig "myapp" created`.

[NOTE]
====
BuildConfigs contain information necessary for building an application. It also
contain information what strategy should be used for building it. In our case
the strategy is `Source`. For strategy from source it contains the URL of git
repository to fetch the source code from and other important stuff. you can
check more details by running `oc describe bc myapp`.
====

BuildConfig is the reference for building stuff and allows us to trigger
the building process, to do this run

[source]
----
oc start-build myapp
----

and you should see something like this

[source]
----
myapp-2
----

once the build finishes, refresh your browser with the application and you
shall see the changes you just made.

==== Deploying the changes using web console

The web UI allows you to trigger builds as well. In the web console go to
`Browser -> Builds` and there you will see a line similar to

image::new-build.png[]

click on the `myapp` and on the next page click the `Start Build` button in
the top right corner.

image::start-build.png[]

then click `Overview` in the main left navigation panel. You will be taken
back to the overview page, where you will see that you build is running

image::running-build.png[]

and once finished

image::finished-build.png[]

you can again click your application URL and see the changes.

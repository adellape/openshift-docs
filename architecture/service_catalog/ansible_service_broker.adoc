== Overview

The OpenShift Ansible broker (OAB) is an implementation of the Open Service
Broker (OSB) API that manages applications defined by
xref:service-catalog-apb[_Ansible playbook bundles (APBs)_]. APBs provide a new
method for defining and distributing container applications in {product-title},
consisting of a bundle of Ansible playbooks built into a container image with an
Ansible runtime. APBs leverage Ansible to create a standard mechanism for
automating complex deployments.

The design of the OAB follows this basic workflow:

. A user requests list of available applications from the service catalog using
the {product-title} web console.
. The service catalog requests the OAB for available applications.
. The OAB communicates with a defined container registry to learn which APBs are
available.
. The user issues a request to provision a specific APB.
. The provision request makes its way to the OAB, which fulfills the user's
request by invoking the provision method on the APB.

== Ansible Playbook Bundles

An Ansible playbook bundle (APB) is a lightweight application definition that
allows you to leverage existing investment in Ansible roles and playbooks.

APBs use a simple directory with named playbooks to perform OSB API actions,
such as provision and bind. Metadata defined in *_apb.yml_* spec file contains a
list of required and optional parameters for use during deployment.

=== Directory Structure

The following shows an example directory structure of an APB:

----
example-apb/
├── Dockerfile
├── apb.yml
└── roles/
│   └── example-apb-openshift
│       ├── defaults
│       │   └── main.yml
│       └── tasks
│           └── main.yml
└── playbooks/
    └── provision.yml
    └── deprovision.yml
    └── bind.yml
    └── unbind.yml
----

[[service-catalog-spec-file]]
=== Spec File

An APB spec file (*_apb.yml_*) must be edited for your specific application. For
example, the `etherpad-apb` spec file looks as follows:

----
name: fusor/etherpad-apb
description: Note taking web application
bindable: true
async: optional
parameters:
  - name: hostport
    description: The host TCP port as the external endpoint
    type: int
    default: 9001
  - name: db_user
    description: Database User
    type: string
----

For an APB that does not have any parameters, the `parameters` field should be
blank:

----
parameters: []

[[service-catalog-actions]]
=== Actions

The following are the actions for an APB. At a minimum, an APB must implement the provision and deprovision actions.

*_provision.yml_*::
Playbook called to handle installing application to the cluster.

*_deprovision.yml_*::
Playbook called to handle uninstalling.

*_bind.yml_*::
Playbook to grant access to another service to use this service. For example,
generating credentials.

*_unbind.yml_*::
Playbook to revoke access to this service.

The required named playbooks correspond to methods defined by the OSB API. For
example, when the OAB needs to provision an APB, it will execute the
*_provision.yml_*.

After the required named playbooks have been generated, the files can be used
directly to test management of the application. A developer may want to work
with this directory of files, make changes, run, and repeat until they are
satisfied with the behavior. They can test the playbooks by invoking Ansible
directly with the playbook and any required variables.

== Projects
A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities. A project is a Kubernetes namespace with
additional annotations.

Each project has its own set of:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Objects*
|Pods, services, replication controllers, etc.

|*Policies*
|Who can or cannot perform actions.

|*Constraints*
|Project quotas.

|===

Cluster administrators can link:../../dev_guide/projects.html[create projects]
and
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#managing-role-bindings[delegate
administrative rights] for the project to any member of the user community.
Cluster administrators can also allow developers to create
link:../../admin_guide/selfprovisioned_projects.html[their own projects].

Developers and administrators can link:../../dev_guide/projects.html[interact
with projects] using link:../../cli_reference/overview.html[the CLI] or the
link:../infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console].

== Namespaces

A namespace provides a mechanism to subdivide resources in a Kubernetes cluster.
In OpenShift, a link:#projects[project] is a Kubernetes namespace with
additional annotations.

Namespaces provides a unique scope for:

- Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.
- Delegated management authority to trusted users.
- The ability to limit community resource consumption.

See the
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/namespaces.md[Kubernetes
documentation] for more information on namespaces.
